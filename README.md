Always student...
A big part of my experience is in Finance, Accounting & Reporting.
I never use a calculator, and my only helper is Excel.
I started to take an interest in the software subject during an ERP setup project for a foreign company, and I decided to step in.
I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to do programming for web development. I continue to learn.
I go on to code with enthusiasm. I get even more excited when I code.
I aim to combine my experience with the projects I developed and share it.
Knowledge is to be shared.
