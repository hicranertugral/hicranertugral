Always student...
Big part of her experience is Finance, Accounting & Reporting...
She never uses a calculator, her only helper is Excel.
She has started to take an interest in the software subject during an Erp set up project of a foreign company and she decided to step in. 
She learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React to do programming for web development... She continues to learn. 
She goes on to code with enthusiasm... She gets even more exciting after she created the new codes. 
Her aim is to combine her experience with the codes she created and share it. 
She believes that knowledge is to be shared.
